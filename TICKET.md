# Frontend Development Ticket

## Ticket: Implement Simple Meal Planning Feature

### Description
Add a basic meal planning feature that allows users to assign meals to specific days of the week. This will be a simple, user-friendly interface where users can select meals and assign them to different days.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a new "Meal Planner" page/component
- [ ] Display a simple weekly view (Monday through Sunday)
- [ ] Allow users to select meals from a dropdown for each day
- [ ] Display the selected meals for each day
- [ ] Add a "Clear Plan" button to reset all selections
- [ ] Add a "Save Plan" button to persist the meal plan
- [ ] Show a success message when plan is saved

### Technical Requirements
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
- Create a simple weekly grid layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox
- Use localStorage to persist meal plan data
- Add basic form validation
- Include loading states and error handling
- Make the interface responsive for mobile devices

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/MealPlanner.jsx` - Main meal planner component
- `src/App.jsx` - Add new route for meal planner
- `src/App.css` - Add basic styling for meal planner
- `src/context/MealContext.jsx` - Add meal planning state (optional)

### Implementation Steps
1. **Create the MealPlanner component** with a simple weekly grid
2. **Add state management** for selected meals per day
3. **Create dropdown menus** for meal selection
4. **Implement localStorage** for saving/loading meal plans
5. **Add basic styling** to make it look clean and organized
6. **Add the route** to App.jsx
7. **Test the functionality** and ensure it works properly

### Example Component Structure
```jsx
// MealPlanner.jsx
const MealPlanner = () => {
  const [mealPlan, setMealPlan] = useState({
    monday: '',
    tuesday: '',
    wednesday: '',
    thursday: '',
    friday: '',
    saturday: '',
    sunday: ''
  })

  // Add functions for:
  // - handleMealSelect(day, meal)
  // - saveMealPlan()
  // - loadMealPlan()
  // - clearMealPlan()
}
```

### Stretch Goals (Optional)
- [ ] Add a "Print Plan" button that generates a simple text version
- [ ] Add meal categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for each day
- [ ] Show nutritional totals for the week
- [ ] Add a "Random Meal" button that assigns random meals to empty days

### Estimated Time
- **Basic Implementation**: 4-6 hours
- **With Stretch Goals**: 6-8 hours

### Learning Objectives
- React state management with useState
- Working with localStorage
- Creating reusable components
- Form handling and validation
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts
- Basic error handling and user feedback

### Resources
- [React useState Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- [React Form Handling](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form)

### Notes
- Keep it simple! Focus on core functionality first
- Use the existing meal data from MealContext

- Test the localStorage functionality thoroughly
- Add helpful comments in your code
- Don't worry about complex styling - focus on functionality

### Success Criteria
